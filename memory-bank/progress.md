# Progress: Discarr

## What Works
- **Core Bot Functionality**: The bot connects to Discord and responds to commands.
- **API Clients**: Radarr and Sonarr clients can connect and fetch data.
- **Download Monitoring**: The `DownloadMonitor` can track active downloads.
- **Health Checking**: The `HealthChecker` can monitor service status.
- **Admin Commands**: Most admin commands are functional.
- **Bug Fix**: The `/cleanup` command error has been resolved.
- **Synchronized Startup**: The initial Discord message now updates immediately after data is loaded.

## What's Left to Build
- **Comprehensive Testing**: The test suite needs to be expanded to cover all command logic and prevent regressions like the recent `await` bug.
- **User-Facing Error Improvements**: Error messages can be made more specific and helpful.
- **Full Command Implementation**: Some commands in the README are not yet fully implemented.
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Add more customization options for Discord notifications.

## Current Status
- **Stable with a Key Fix**: The bot is generally stable, and a critical bug in the `/cleanup` command has been patched.
- **Ready for Testing**: The recent fix needs to be verified in a live environment.
- **Documentation Initiated**: The Memory Bank has been created and populated with initial project context.

## Known Issues
- **Insufficient Test Coverage**: The current test suite does not cover all critical paths, particularly at the command level.
- **Generic Error Messages**: Some user-facing error messages are too generic (e.g., "An error occurred").

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Implementation**: Focused on core features and API connectivity.
- **Bug Discovery**: A runtime `TypeError` in the `/cleanup` command revealed a gap in async programming practices.
- **Decision to Improve Testing**: The bug highlighted the need for more robust testing to catch logical errors, not just syntax issues.
- **Memory Bank Creation**: The project now has a formal documentation structure to maintain context and track progress.
