# Progress: Discarr

## What Works
- **Core Bot Functionality**: The bot connects to Discord and responds to commands without interaction timeouts.
- **API Clients**: Radarr and Sonarr clients can connect and fetch data.
- **Download Monitoring**: The `DownloadMonitor` can track active downloads.
- **Health Checking**: The `HealthChecker` is fully asynchronous and monitors service status without blocking the bot.
- **Admin Commands**: All admin commands are functional.
- **Synchronized Startup**: The initial Discord message now updates immediately after data is loaded.
- **Relative Timestamps**: Elapsed time is now correctly formatted as a relative timestamp in Discord embeds.
- **Long-Running Command Handling**: The `/cleanup` command now uses a "defer -> respond -> edit" pattern for better UX and reliability.
- **Async Purity**: The entire codebase is now much more robust against blocking I/O, with permission and health checks being fully asynchronous.

## What's Left to Build
- **Comprehensive Testing**: The test suite needs to be expanded to cover all command logic and prevent regressions.
- **User-Facing Error Improvements**: Error messages can be made more specific and helpful.
- **Full Command Implementation**: Some commands in the README are not yet fully implemented.
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Add more customization options for Discord notifications.

## Current Status
- **Stable**: The bot is now stable. The root cause of all interaction timeout errors (blocking I/O in the health check loop) has been identified and fixed.
- **Ready for Deployment**: The bot is ready for deployment.
- **Documentation Updated**: The Memory Bank is up-to-date with the latest changes.

## Known Issues
- **Insufficient Test Coverage**: The current test suite does not cover all critical paths, particularly at the command level.
- **Generic Error Messages**: Some user-facing error messages are too generic (e.g., "An error occurred").

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Implementation**: Focused on core features and API connectivity.
- **Bug Discovery**: A persistent interaction timeout issue revealed a critical bug where a synchronous background task (`HealthChecker`) was blocking the entire event loop.
- **Decision to Improve Testing**: The bugs highlighted the need for more robust testing to catch logical and async-related errors.
- **Memory Bank Creation**: The project now has a formal documentation structure to maintain context and track progress.
- **UI/UX Improvement**: The timestamp formatting fix and the new handling for long-running commands improve the user experience.
- **Async Purity**: This incident reinforced the absolute necessity of ensuring all I/O operations, especially in background tasks, are non-blocking.
