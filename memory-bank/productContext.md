# Product Context: Discarr

## Why This Project Exists
Discarr bridges the gap between media server management and Discord communication. Media enthusiasts and server administrators need a convenient way to monitor and manage their Radarr and Sonarr instances without leaving their Discord environment.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Fragmented Monitoring**: Users had to check multiple web interfaces to monitor download status
2. **Delayed Notifications**: No real-time alerts for download completion or failures
3. **Manual Management**: Required web interface access for basic queue management tasks
4. **Limited Mobile Access**: Web interfaces aren't optimized for mobile Discord usage
5. **Team Coordination**: Multiple users couldn't easily coordinate media server management

## How It Should Work
- **Seamless Integration**: Commands feel native to Discord with rich embeds and interactive elements
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant notifications for download events and system status changes
- **Intuitive Commands**: Simple slash commands that don't require technical knowledge
- **Smart Monitoring**: Automatic detection of stuck downloads and system issues
- **Secure Access**: Role-based permissions ensuring only authorized users can manage servers

## User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Feedback**: All commands respond quickly with clear status information
- **Visual Clarity**: Rich embeds with color coding and progress indicators
- **Error Recovery**: Helpful error messages with suggested solutions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic commands for casual users, advanced features for power users
- **Mobile Friendly**: All interactions work well on mobile Discord clients

## Target Users
1. **Home Media Enthusiasts**: Personal media server owners
2. **Community Server Admins**: Managing shared media libraries
3. **Technical Teams**: DevOps teams monitoring media infrastructure
4. **Family Groups**: Shared household media management

## Success Metrics
- Commands execute successfully >95% of the time
- Average response time <3 seconds for status commands
- Users can complete common tasks without leaving Discord
- Reduced time spent checking web interfaces manually
- Improved awareness of download issues and system health
