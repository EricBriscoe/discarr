# Active Context: Discarr

## Current Work Focus
- **Feature**: Synchronized the initial data load with the Discord message update.
- **Cause**: The Discord message would show "Loading" on startup, even after the data was loaded, because the message refresh was not synchronized with the data loading process.
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/monitoring/download_monitor.py`
  - `src/monitoring/cache_manager.py`

## Recent Changes
- **`download_monitor.py`**:
  - Added an `asyncio.Event` called `initial_load_event` to signal the completion of the initial data load.
  - Passed the event to the `CacheManager`.
  - The `_monitor_loop` now waits for the `initial_load_event` before starting its regular monitoring.
  - An immediate `check_downloads()` is called after the event is set.
- **`cache_manager.py`**:
  - The `__init__` method now accepts the `initial_load_event`.
  - The `_async_refresh_data` method now sets the `initial_load_event` after both Radarr and Sonarr data have been loaded for the first time.

## Next Steps
1. **Verify Fix**: Confirm that the Discord message updates immediately after the initial data load.
2. **Improve Testing**: Add a unit test to verify the new synchronization mechanism.
3. **Documentation**: Update the Memory Bank to reflect the changes.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Async Best Practices**: Reinforce the importance of `await`ing all coroutines. The recent bug highlights a gap in async code patterns.
- **Error Handling**: The `try...except` block in `cleanup_command` caught the error, but the user-facing message was generic. Consider providing more specific error feedback.
- **Testing Strategy**: The bug was not caught by existing tests, indicating a need for more comprehensive integration or command-level testing.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **`async/await`**: All I/O-bound operations must be awaited.
- **Error Isolation**: `try...except` blocks should be used to isolate failures and prevent them from crashing the bot.
- **Clear Logging**: Log errors with `exc_info=True` to provide full context for debugging.

## Learnings & Project Insights
- A simple mistake like a missing `await` can cause critical runtime errors.
- Static analysis tools (like `flake8`) may not always catch this type of logical error.
- Robust testing at the command level is crucial for ensuring reliability.
