# Active Context: Discarr

## Current Work Focus
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved a timeout issue with the `/cleanup` command.
- **Cause**: The command was taking too long to execute, causing the Discord interaction token to expire. The previous implementation deferred the interaction but didn't provide immediate feedback, leading to a poor user experience and potential timeouts on slow systems.
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/discord_bot/commands/admin.py`

## Recent Changes
- **`admin.py`**:
  - Refactored the `cleanup_command` to provide immediate feedback to the user.
  - The command now sends an "in progress" message immediately after deferring the interaction.
  - After the cleanup tasks are complete, it edits the original message with the final results.
  - This prevents the interaction from timing out and improves the user experience.

## Next Steps
1. **Update Progress**: Update `progress.md` to reflect the fix.
2. **Final Review**: Review all changes to ensure they are correct and complete.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Handling Long-Running Tasks**: Long-running commands must provide immediate feedback to the user to avoid timeouts and improve UX. The "defer -> respond -> edit" pattern is the preferred way to handle this.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **User Feedback**: Prioritize providing clear and immediate feedback for all bot interactions.

## Learnings & Project Insights
- A simple `defer` is not always enough for long-running tasks. Providing an initial response and then editing it is a more robust pattern.
- User-reported bugs can sometimes point to deeper architectural or UX issues that need to be addressed.
