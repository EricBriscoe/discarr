# Active Context: Discarr

## Current Work Focus
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved a persistent timeout issue with the `/cleanup` command.
- **Cause**: The interaction token was expiring before the command could be deferred. The root cause was suspected to be a blocking call in the permission-checking functions (`has_admin_permissions` and `is_guild_owner`).
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/discord_bot/commands/admin.py`
  - `src/utils/interaction_utils.py`

## Recent Changes
- **`interaction_utils.py`**:
  - Converted `has_admin_permissions` and `is_guild_owner` to `async def` functions to prevent any potential blocking I/O on the event loop.
- **`admin.py`**:
  - Updated all calls to `has_admin_permissions` and `is_guild_owner` to use `await`.
  - This ensures that the permission checks are non-blocking and happen asynchronously.

## Next Steps
1. **Update Progress**: Update `progress.md` to reflect this final fix.
2. **Final Review**: Confirm that this resolves the user's issue.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Async Everywhere**: When in doubt, make utility functions that interact with `discord.py` objects asynchronous to avoid blocking the event loop. Even seemingly simple property accesses can sometimes trigger I/O.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **Non-Blocking Code**: It is critical to ensure that no code blocks the event loop, especially in command handlers before a deferral.

## Learnings & Project Insights
- The most obscure bugs are often related to blocking I/O in an async environment.
- When a command is timing out before deferral, every single line of code before the `defer()` call is a suspect, no matter how innocent it looks.
