# Active Context: Discarr

## Current Work Focus
- **Bug Fix**: Resolved a critical error in the `/cleanup` command.
- **Cause**: The command was not `await`ing async functions (`remove_stuck_downloads`, `remove_inactive_items`), leading to a `TypeError` when trying to add coroutine objects.
- **File Modified**: `src/discord_bot/commands/admin.py`

## Recent Changes
- Added `await` to the following function calls in `cleanup_command`:
  - `download_monitor.cache_manager.radarr_client.remove_stuck_downloads()`
  - `download_monitor.cache_manager.sonarr_client.remove_stuck_downloads()`
  - `download_monitor.cache_manager.radarr_client.remove_inactive_items()`
  - `download_monitor.cache_manager.sonarr_client.remove_inactive_items()`

## Next Steps
1. **Verify Fix**: Confirm that the `/cleanup` command now executes without errors.
2. **Improve Testing**: Add a unit test to `tests/unit/test_download_monitor_cleanup.py` to specifically cover the `cleanup_command` logic and prevent regressions.
3. **Documentation**: Update the Memory Bank to reflect the fix and current project state.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Async Best Practices**: Reinforce the importance of `await`ing all coroutines. The recent bug highlights a gap in async code patterns.
- **Error Handling**: The `try...except` block in `cleanup_command` caught the error, but the user-facing message was generic. Consider providing more specific error feedback.
- **Testing Strategy**: The bug was not caught by existing tests, indicating a need for more comprehensive integration or command-level testing.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- **`async/await`**: All I/O-bound operations must be awaited.
- **Error Isolation**: `try...except` blocks should be used to isolate failures and prevent them from crashing the bot.
- **Clear Logging**: Log errors with `exc_info=True` to provide full context for debugging.

## Learnings & Project Insights
- A simple mistake like a missing `await` can cause critical runtime errors.
- Static analysis tools (like `flake8`) may not always catch this type of logical error.
- Robust testing at the command level is crucial for ensuring reliability.
