# Progress Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of intelligent progress tracking for stuck download detection in the Discarr Discord bot. The new system replaces the flawed cleanup logic with a sophisticated in-memory progress analysis system.

## Problem Solved

### Original Issue
The `/cleanup` command had flawed logic that:
- Only removed items based on current status, not actual progress
- Used crude "all unknown time" detection
- Failed to identify truly stuck downloads that maintained "downloading" status but made no progress

### Solution Implemented
- **In-memory progress tracking** over configurable time windows
- **Historical progress analysis** to identify downloads with no progress over time
- **Smart cleanup logic** that removes both stuck downloads and inactive items
- **Detailed reporting** showing exactly what was removed and why

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

#### 1. `progress_tracker.py`
- **ProgressSnapshot**: Dataclass for storing point-in-time download progress
- **ProgressTracker**: Main class for tracking and analyzing download progress
- Features:
  - Records progress snapshots every 5 seconds
  - Maintains rolling window of progress history (default: 4 hours)
  - Analyzes downloads for stuck detection
  - Automatic memory management with configurable limits

#### 2. `test_imports.py`
- Simple test script to verify imports and basic functionality
- Can be used for debugging and validation

#### 3. `PROGRESS_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- This documentation file

### Modified Files

#### 1. `config.py`
**Added configuration options:**
```python
STUCK_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 120        # 2 hours no progress
MIN_PROGRESS_CHANGE = 1.0            # 1% progress change required
MIN_SIZE_CHANGE = 104857600          # 100MB size change required
PROGRESS_HISTORY_HOURS = 4           # 4 hours of snapshots
MAX_SNAPSHOTS_PER_DOWNLOAD = 50      # Max 50 snapshots per download
```

#### 2. `cache_manager.py`
**Integrated progress tracking:**
- Added `ProgressTracker` instance
- Records progress snapshots during data refresh
- Exposes progress analysis methods
- Thread-safe progress tracking

#### 3. `arr_client.py`
**Enhanced cleanup methods:**
- Added `remove_stuck_downloads()` method
- Improved error handling
- Safety checks for None values

#### 4. `discord_client.py`
**Completely rewritten cleanup command:**
- Replaced flawed logic with progress-based analysis
- Added detailed reporting with statistics
- Added new `/progress` command for monitoring
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

#### 5. `README.md`
**Updated documentation:**
- Documented new `/progress` command
- Explained smart cleanup features
- Added configuration options section
- Detailed the progress tracking system

#### 6. `.env.example`
**Added new configuration options:**
- All progress tracking settings with explanations
- Sensible defaults for all options

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Stuck Detection
- **Time-based analysis**: Tracks downloads over configurable time windows
- **Multi-factor detection**: Considers progress percentage, size changes, and time
- **Status awareness**: Only considers active downloads as potentially stuck
- **Configurable thresholds**: All detection parameters are user-configurable

### 2. Memory Management
- **Bounded memory usage**: Automatic cleanup of old snapshots
- **Rolling windows**: Maintains only recent history within time limits
- **Snapshot limits**: Maximum snapshots per download to prevent memory bloat
- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes tracking data for completed downloads

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Detailed reporting**: Shows exactly what was analyzed and removed
- **Progress statistics**: `/progress` command shows tracking status
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded embeds based on results
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and errors

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **Existing functionality preserved**: All original features still work
- **Optional configuration**: New features work with sensible defaults
- **Gradual adoption**: Users can adjust thresholds as needed

## Configuration Options

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `STUCK_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` | 120 | Minutes without progress before considered stuck |
| `MIN_PROGRESS_CHANGE` | 1.0 | Minimum % progress change required |
| `MIN_SIZE_CHANGE` | 104857600 | Minimum bytes downloaded required (100MB) |
| `PROGRESS_HISTORY_HOURS` | 4 | Hours of progress history to keep |
| `MAX_SNAPSHOTS_PER_DOWNLOAD` | 50 | Maximum snapshots per download |

## Memory Usage

- **Typical usage**: ~500KB for 100 active downloads
- **Per download**: ~5KB (50 snapshots Ã— ~100 bytes each)
- **Automatic bounds**: Memory usage is automatically limited by time windows and snapshot limits
- **No persistence**: All data is in-memory, fresh start after restart

## Commands

### `/cleanup` (Enhanced)
- Analyzes progress history to identify stuck downloads
- Removes both stuck downloads and inactive items
- Provides detailed reporting of actions taken
- Shows progress tracking statistics

### `/progress` (New)
- Shows current progress tracking statistics
- Lists currently stuck downloads
- Displays configuration settings
- Useful for monitoring and debugging

### `/check` and `/verbose` (Unchanged)
- Existing functionality preserved
- Work seamlessly with new progress tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Progress Tracking Flow
1. **Data Collection**: Every 5 seconds during normal refresh cycle
2. **Snapshot Creation**: Progress, size, status, timestamp recorded
3. **History Management**: Old snapshots automatically pruned
4. **Analysis**: On-demand analysis identifies stuck downloads
5. **Action**: Cleanup removes identified stuck downloads

### Thread Safety
- **Locks**: Progress tracking uses thread-safe operations
- **Isolation**: Background tracking doesn't interfere with main operations
- **Atomic updates**: Snapshot recording is atomic and non-blocking

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues working if tracking fails
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **User feedback**: Clear error messages in Discord responses

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Detection**: Identifies truly stuck downloads, not just inactive ones
2. **Historical Context**: Makes decisions based on progress trends over time
3. **Configurable**: Admins can adjust thresholds based on their setup
4. **Transparent**: Clear reporting on why items were removed
5. **Preventive**: Can identify potential issues before they become problems
6. **Lightweight**: Minimal memory footprint with automatic management
7. **No Dependencies**: Pure in-memory solution, no external storage required

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:
- Visual progress indicators in Discord display
- Automatic warnings for downloads approaching stuck threshold
- Integration with download client APIs for more detailed progress info
- Historical statistics and trends
- Predictive analysis for download completion times

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Basic import and instantiation tests
- Error handling for edge cases
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Thread safety considerations
- Memory management validation

## Conclusion

This implementation transforms the Discarr cleanup functionality from a crude status-based system to an intelligent progress-analysis system. It provides accurate stuck download detection while maintaining simplicity and requiring no external dependencies.
